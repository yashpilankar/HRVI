# Dataset For Detecting Violation of Human Rights via Social Media

The given dataset is published as a benchmark for Machine Learning Models used for _Detection of Human Rights Violation_. It was extracted from Twitter from Twitter using Twitter API where more the 10000+ tweets are extracted based on different methodology which are relevant for the task. The task is identification of human rights violation through social media posts. In short, it is a binary classification task where given a Tweet it checks whether there is any incident about human rights violation. We labelled a Tweet with “1” when we see that it contains information, event, fact or incident about human rights violation. The concerned Tweet may also contain location where the incident occurred. The additional clues that we considered for tagging were: (i) there may be a victim such as any community, person, group of people, and (ii) information about the assailant who violated the rights. In our case, it is more focused on facts that is encoded in the Tweet. In sum, we labeled each of the collected clean Tweets with either one of the two categories: ‘1’ (indicating the violation of human rights), ‘0’ (normal post that does not indicate any violation of human rights). Note that since data annotation is an expensive and time-consuming task, we had only single annotator for this task, who is a native speaker of English and has excellent knowledge in Tweets or micro blogs.
